# IMPORT MATH FUNCTIONS
    #1 import math (imports MODULE math)
    #2 use the built in functions: example: math.sqrt(25)
    #3 floor rounds 2,8 to 2// ceil rounds 2,1 to 3
    #4 power: math.pow(3,3): first argument number, second the power
    #5 math function can also call CONSTANTS like PI: math.pi or math.e
    #6 you can import math as a shortcut like m or any other letter: import math as m
    #7 or you can just import some of the functions: from math import sqrt, pow
    #8 in this last case you dont need to put math at the beginnint, just the function: sqrt(25)
    #9 help for math: help('math")
