#MAIN DIFFERENCE
#LIST : mutable / uses []
#TUPLE : unmutable/ uses ()/ has just COUNT AND INDEX
tuple1 = (4, 15, 25, 38)
print(tuple1)
print(tuple1.count) #count: built in method from tuple
tuple2 = (4,15, 'rojo')
print(tuple2)
#SET: uses {}/ when you print it, the output will be random, not in the way you input it
#indexing is not possible
#does not support duplicate values
set1 = {12, 25, 36, 47, 58, 58, 69}
