# FIRST CHECK ON W3 WEBSITE. THERE ARE EXTRA ONES

# ARITHMETIC OPERATORS
    #  + - * /
    # % modular: resto de la division// 5 % 3 = 2
    # // floor division: rounds result to whole number: 15 // 7 = 2
    # ** exponential

# ASSIGMENT OPERATORS
    # multiple assignment: a, b = 5, 6
    # assigning negative value : x = 5 and after -x

# RELATIONAL OPERATORS (COMPARISON)
# BOOLEAN OUTPUT
    # ==
    # <
    # >
    # <=
    # >=
    # !=

# LOGICAL OPERATORS
    # and: Returns True if both statements are true
    # or: Returns True if one of the statements is true
    # not: Reverse the result, returns False if the result is true
        # not (x > 10)
        # not (x > 10 and x < 8)
        # not (x > 10 or x < 8)
        # x = True, then not (x) = False

# BITWISE OPERATORS (use 13 and 12 for easy examples)
    # ~: NOT (complement operator): inverts all bits. 0 to 1 and 1 to 0
    # &: bitwise AND operator: Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1
    # |: bitweise OR operator: Sets each bit to 1 if one of two bits is 1
    # ^: bitweise XOR operator: Sets each bit to 1 if ONLY one of two bits is 1
    # <<: zero fill left shift: 10 << 2: fills with two zeros to the right
    # >>: deletes the last bites from the right, depending on 2nd argument
